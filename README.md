## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm currently studying at the Singapore Institute of Technology, where I've led multiple team-based robotics projects. My passion lies in solving real-world problems through smart, reliable autonomous systems.  

From ROS navigation and SLAM to low-level firmware programming, I enjoy integrating software and hardware into efficient robotic solutions. I also run a Telegram channel on smart property investing.
